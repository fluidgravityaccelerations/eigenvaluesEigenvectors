## PyTorch Batched SVD with Generic Data Types

Batched singular value decompositions (SVD) on GPU using PyTorch, with support for both real and complex matrix types:

- **Underlying Algorithm**  
  - On **CPU**, `torch.linalg.svd(..., full_matrices=False)` dispatches to LAPACK’s divide‐and‐conquer driver `*gesdd` (falling back to `*gesvd` if needed).  
  - On **CUDA**, it calls MAGMA’s `gesvd` implementation, which likewise performs bidiagonalization followed by a divide‐and‐conquer solve of the bidiagonal SVD.

## PyTorch Batched Singular-Values-Only SVD with Generic Data Types

Batched computation of singular values only on GPU using PyTorch, with support for both real and complex matrices.

- **Underlying Algorithm**
  CPU: Dispatches to LAPACK’s divide-and-conquer driver *gesdd (with fallback to *gesvd).
  CUDA: Calls MAGMA’s gesvd implementation, which performs bidiagonalization followed by a divide-and-conquer solve, while only materializing the singular values.
