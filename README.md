## PyTorch Batched SVD with Generic Data Types

Batched singular value decompositions (SVD) on GPU using PyTorch, with support for both real and complex matrix types:

- **Underlying Algorithm**  
  - On **CPU**, `torch.linalg.svd(..., full_matrices=False)` dispatches to LAPACK‚Äôs divide‚Äêand‚Äêconquer driver `*gesdd` (falling back to `*gesvd` if needed).  
  - On **CUDA**, it calls MAGMA‚Äôs `gesvd` implementation, which likewise performs bidiagonalization followed by a divide‚Äêand‚Äêconquer solve of the bidiagonal SVD.

## PyTorch Batched Singular-Values-Only SVD with Generic Data Types

Batched computation of singular values only on GPU using PyTorch, with support for both real and complex matrices.

- **Underlying Algorithm**
  CPU: Dispatches to LAPACK‚Äôs divide-and-conquer driver *gesdd (with fallback to *gesvd).
  CUDA: Calls MAGMA‚Äôs gesvd implementation, which performs bidiagonalization followed by a divide-and-conquer solve, while only materializing the singular values.

## JAX Batched SVD with Generic Data Types

Batched singular value decompositions (SVD) on GPU (and CPU) using JAX, with support for both real and complex matrix types:

- **Underlying Algorithm**  
  - On **CPU**, JAX‚Äôs `jax.numpy.linalg.svd` is implemented in XLA using Eigen‚Äôs divide-and-conquer bidiagonalization driver (analogous to LAPACK‚Äôs `*gesdd`, with a fallback to `*gesvd`).  
  - On **CUDA**, it issues an XLA custom-call to NVIDIA cuSolver‚Äôs `gesvd` divide-and-conquer solver (and, for smaller batched workloads, can fall back to the `gesvdj` Jacobi-based implementation).

## JAX Batched Singular-Values-Only SVD with Generic Data Types

Batched computation of singular values only on CPU and GPU using JAX, with support for both real and complex matrices.

- **Underlying Algorithm**  
  - **CPU**: Uses XLA‚Äôs SVD high-level operation, which on CPU dispatches (via Eigen‚Äôs LAPACK bindings) to the divide-and-conquer driver `*gesdd` (with fallback to `*gesvd`) to compute singular values only when `compute_uv=False`. :contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}  
  - **CUDA**: The same XLA SVD HLO is lowered to call cuSolver‚Äôs `gesvd` (divide-and-conquer) backend, materializing only the singular values when `compute_uv=False`. :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}

## CuPy Batched Singular-Values-Only SVD with Generic Data Types

Batched computation of singular values only on GPU using CuPy, with support for both real and complex matrices.

- **Underlying Algorithm**
  - **CPU**: Dispatches to SciPy/LAPACK‚Äôs divide-and-conquer driver `gesdd` (with fallback to `gesvd`).
  - **CUDA (CuPy)**: Calls cuSOLVER‚Äôs **`gesvdaStridedBatched`** driver, which performs bidiagonalization followed by a divide-and-conquer solve‚Äîand when `compute_uv=False` only materializes the singular values.

## CuPy Batched Singular-Values-Only SVD with Generic Data Types

Batched computation of singular values only on GPU using cuPy, with support for both real and complex matrices.

- **Underlying Algorithm**
  - **CPU:** Dispatches to LAPACK‚Äôs divide-and-conquer driver `*gesdd` (falling back to `*gesvd` when necessary).
  - **CUDA:** Calls CUDA Toolkit‚Äôs cuSOLVER `gesvd` (divide-and-conquer) implementation for real and complex types, with a fallback to the Jacobi-based `gesvdj` solver when higher accuracy or robustness is required.

## CuPy Batched Full SVD with Generic Data Types

Batched computation of full singular‚Äêvalue decomposition on GPU using CuPy, with support for both real and complex matrices.

- **Underlying Algorithm**
  - **CPU**: Dispatches to LAPACK‚Äôs divide-and-conquer driver *gesdd (with fallback to *gesvd).
  - **CUDA**: Calls NVIDIA cuSOLVER‚Äôs gesvd (divide-and-conquer) implementation, which performs bidiagonalization followed by a divide-and-conquer solve to produce the full U, Œ£ and V·µÄ factors.
